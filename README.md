# Morph sphere to cube

i watched the [veil] MV and the first animation was of a sphere morphing into a cube so i made it

unfortunately, i have no idea how to apply materials onto it, so rn its just a bunch of vertices that change position

i bet there is a way more efficient way of doing this but it works and it looks cool

oh yeah, theres also a circle morphing into a cube idk

# Morph sphere to cube

i watched a music video and it had an animation of a sphere morphing into a cube so i made it

you can also enable the solid material on the live demo

i bet there is a way more efficient way of doing this but it works and it looks cool

oh yeah, theres also a circle morphing into a cube idk
